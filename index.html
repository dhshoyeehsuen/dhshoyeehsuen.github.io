  <p>I have had 20 hamsters so far, but I currently only have 7. I have been taking care of hamsters ever since Primary School.</p>

  <h4>School</h4>
  <p>My favourite subjects in school are
    <ul>
      <li>English</li>
      <li>Mathematics</li>
      <li>Science</li>
  </ul>
  All 3 subjects are interesting to me and I am no that bad at them, which is why I prefer them over other subjects.</p>
  <p>However, I am hoping to work harder in my coming years so that all of my subjects can be improved.</p>
